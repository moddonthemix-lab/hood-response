# 🪰 Swarm the Fly

**Ultra-low-latency wallet-swarm alert bot for Robinhood Chain.**

Swarm the Fly monitors a curated set of wallets and fires an alert the moment
*multiple* tracked wallets buy or sell the **same token** inside a short time
window — coordinated accumulation, coordinated dumps, and capital rotation —
before the broader market reacts. Detection runs entirely in memory for
sub-second latency; Postgres and Redis are optional archival layers.

Built from the *Robinhood Chain Alpha Intelligence* spec and seeded with the
**Robinhood Smart-Money Conviction List** — 15 tokens (8 curated + 7 auto-fetched
top coins) and 131 real tracked wallets, tiered by holder rank, with 10
cross-coin conviction wallets. Refresh/expand the list any time with
`node scripts/fetch-holders.mjs SYMBOL …`.

## What it does

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **New-coin discovery** | ≥ N tracked wallets buy the **same token that isn't on the list** → 🆕 alert with the contract, and the token auto-registers on the dashboard. This is the early-signal mode: it follows the *wallets*, not a fixed token set. Toggle with `DISCOVERY_MODE` |
| **Swarm detection** | ≥ N unique tracked wallets BUY the same token within a window → alert |
| **Safety filter** | before any alert fires, the token is screened via GoPlus token-security (honeypot, buy/sell tax, mintable, ownership, LP lock — supported on Robinhood Chain) + a minimum DEX liquidity check; rugs/honeypots are suppressed (still shown on the dashboard, tagged). Tunable via `SAFETY_*`, degrades to a liquidity-only check if GoPlus is unreachable |
| **Solo low-cap alerts** | a *single* tracked wallet buying a coin fires an alert too — but only when the token's market cap is inside the band `SOLO_MIN_MARKETCAP`–`SOLO_MAX_MARKETCAP` (default $25k–$120k), to catch early low-cap entries without dust or large caps |
| **Fresh-pair first entry** | fires when a qualifying-tier wallet (`FRESH_ENTRY_TIERS`, default alpha+beta) makes its *first-ever* buy of a token whose DEX pair is younger than `FRESH_PAIR_MAX_AGE_HOURS` (default 48h) — the purest "ground floor" signal |
| **Global alert floors** | *every* alert type is gated by `ALERT_MIN_MARKETCAP` (default $25k) and `PAIR_MIN_AGE_MINUTES` (default 30 min) — nothing below the cap floor or on a pair younger than the age floor ever fires |
| **Real market cap** | market cap is fetched live from DexScreener at alert time (not just the cached/synthetic value), so every alert reports the true cap it was bought/sold into |
| **Volume + momentum** | alerts show 24h volume, recent price change, and buy pressure; when volume + direction confirm momentum the alert is flagged 🔥 and conviction is boosted (up to +15). Optional `MOMENTUM_MIN_VOLUME_USD` gate suppresses dead tokens |
| **Repeat / escalation counter** | every alert reports how many times the *same token* has alerted inside a rolling window (`REPEAT_WINDOW_MINUTES`, default 35) — "🔁 REPEAT x3 · 3rd alert in 35m" — plus the **% price move since the previous alert** and how many **distinct** tracked wallets have driven it. It's **wallet-aware**: a brand-new top holder joining always breaks through the cooldown and is highlighted harder ("🚨 NEW HOLDER IN"), while the *same* busy wallet re-buying the same coin is suppressed so it can't hog the feed or masquerade as a swarm. Escalation conviction is keyed on distinct wallets (+4 each, capped +12) with an extra +4 when a new holder joins. Dashboard rows show a `🔁x{n}` / `🚨 NEW HOLDER` badge with the % move |
| **Outcome tracking** | after every alert fires, the token's price is followed and the peak + 1h/6h/24h returns are recorded, so signal quality is measured from **real results** rather than guessed. The `/api/performance` view (and dashboard **Best Calls** card) ranks calls by peak gain and breaks win-rate down by the dimensions that catch runners — **multi-wallet vs solo** and **repeat vs single** — so you can see which setups actually pay and tune from data. Tunable via `PERFORMANCE_TRACKING`, `PERF_SAMPLE_MINUTES`, `PERF_TRACK_HOURS`, `PERF_WIN_THRESHOLD_PCT`. Set `PERF_STORE_PATH` to a mounted Railway Volume (e.g. `/data/performance.json`) to persist outcomes across redeploys — otherwise the data is in-memory and resets on restart |
| **Sell detection** | ≥ N wallets SELL the same token → bearish alert |
| **Rotation detection** | wallets SELL token A then BUY token B → rotation alert |
| **Noise filter** | settlement/quote tokens (WETH, USDC, USDG…) and tokenised equities (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA…) are dropped before detection via `IGNORE_SYMBOLS`, so the feed and alerts stay focused on real gems (no spurious "sold WETH" leg on every buy) |
| **Conviction refinement** | after detection, conviction is re-scored with the *real* market cap, liquidity and momentum — low caps and healthy liquidity get a boost, dangerously thin liquidity a penalty — so the best low-cap gems rank highest |
| **Blue-chip buy/sell filter** | toggle whether tracked-wallet **buys** and **sells** of the coins we already track (the seed set — CASHCAT, PONS, YOLO, HMM…) can alert. Turn a side off to weed out whales just rotating money between known coins, so alerts focus on new low-caps. Two independent switches on the dashboard **Alert Filters** card or `POST /api/bluechip/{buys,sells}`; seed defaults with `BLUE_CHIP_BUYS` / `BLUE_CHIP_SELLS` |
| **Mutable wallet groups** | turn a whole coin's tracked wallets off/on at runtime — click the coin in the dashboard's **Wallet Groups** card, or `POST`/`DELETE /api/muted/:symbol` (seed defaults with `MUTE_WALLET_TOKENS`). A wallet is only silenced when *every* coin it's a top-holder of is muted, so cross-conviction wallets that also hold other gems keep firing. Muted wallets drop out before detection — they never form or grow a swarm, solo, or entry |
| **Wallet tiers** | each wallet is tiered by its best top-10 holder rank across the tracked coins — **alpha** (rank 1–3), **beta** (4–6), **chroma** (7–9), **delta** (10) — which anchors its confidence and feeds the conviction score; alert makeup reads e.g. "2 alpha · 1 beta" |
| **Conviction score** | 0–100 from wallet quality (tier), count, capital, velocity, liquidity, market cap, historical accuracy, buy/sell ratio |
| **Live prices & market cap** | real USD price / market cap / pair link from DexScreener (cached, background-refreshed, chain-filtered) when `DEXSCREENER_CHAIN` is set; deterministic synthetic fallback (marked `est`) otherwise |
| **Market cap context** | every swarm/alert reports the token market cap it was bought/sold into |
| **Address privacy** | wallet addresses are never surfaced in alerts, the dashboard, or the API feeds/SSE — only wallet counts and a category makeup (e.g. "3 smart-money · 1 whale") are shown |
| **Scanner-style cards** | Telegram alerts render as a rich HTML card (bold title, conviction bar, price/MC/liq/vol/age, 24h & 1h change, buy/sell counts, tier makeup, cross-holding overlap) with clickable **Chart** (DexScreener) + **Explorer** (Blockscout) links |
| **DexScreener links** | every alert and dashboard token links straight to its DexScreener chart; set `DEXSCREENER_CHAIN` for direct token pages, otherwise universal address search |
| **Configurable rules** | min wallets, time window, min USD, min conviction, cooldown, kinds, ignored tokens/wallets, ignore dust, ignore stablecoins, ignore duplicate wallets |
| **Notifications** | Discord webhook, Telegram bot, generic REST webhook (each optional) |
| **Live dashboard** | self-contained page at `/` — live feed, swarms, alerts, leaderboards, tracked wallets, latency/health, updated over SSE |
| **REST API** | wallets, tokens, swaps, swarms, alerts, rules, leaderboards, stats, health, config |

```

**The bot ships live by default.** It polls Robinhood Chain's public HTTP RPC
(`https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com`, chain id 4663) every few seconds
via `eth_getLogs`, pulling Transfer logs for the tracked wallets and decoding
them into swaps — no paid provider or WebSocket required. Point `CHAIN_WS_URL`
at a streaming provider (Alchemy/QuickNode) to use lower-latency websocket
subscriptions instead.

In **discovery mode** (default), it filters logs by tracked-**wallet** topics
rather than by token, so it catches those wallets buying *any* token —
including brand-new coins, which are auto-registered and priced. Set
`DISCOVERY_MODE=false` to watch only the seeded tokens.

Set `CHAIN_MODE=simulator` to run without the chain — it replays synthetic
coordinated swaps (including periodic new-coin swarms) so the whole pipeline
(detection → conviction → alerts → dashboard) is exercised with zero external
dependencies.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # optional — sensible defaults, simulator mode
npm run dev                 # hot-reload dev server
# or
npm run build && npm start  # production
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** for the dashboard.

### Point it at a live chain

```bash
CHAIN_WS_URL=wss://<robinhood-chain-rpc> CHAIN_MODE=live npm start
```

The listener subscribes to ERC-20 `Transfer` logs for the tracked tokens,
classifies each as a BUY (tracked wallet receiving) or SELL (tracked wallet
sending), auto-reconnects with exponential backoff, and reports block height +
RPC latency to the dashboard.

> **Prices:** `DEXSCREENER_CHAIN` (default `robinhood`) pulls real USD price,
> market cap, and pair links from DexScreener. The slug selects the pair on the
> right chain rather than a same-address token elsewhere. Clear it to fall back
> to a deterministic synthetic placeholder (market cap shown as `est`). See
> `src/chain/price.ts`.

## Configuration

Everything is configured via environment variables (see `.env.example`) and
alert rules are additionally editable at runtime through the API. Key vars:

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` / `HOST` | `8080` / `0.0.0.0` | HTTP bind |
| `CHAIN_WS_URL` | — | Robinhood Chain WS RPC; empty ⇒ simulator |
| `CHAIN_MODE` | `auto` | `live`, `simulator`, or `auto` |
| `ALERT_MIN_WALLETS` | `2` | default swarm threshold |
| `ALERT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `300` | default detection window (5 min) |
| `ALERT_MIN_USD` / `ALERT_MIN_CONVICTION` | `0` / `0` | default gates |
| `ALERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `120` | per rule/token/kind cooldown |
| `REPEAT_WINDOW_MINUTES` | `35` | rolling window for the repeat/escalation counter |
| `IGNORE_DUST_USD` | `25` | drop swaps below this notional |
| `IGNORE_STABLECOINS` | `true` | ignore tokens flagged stable |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | Discord alerts |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | — | Telegram alerts |
| `GENERIC_WEBHOOK_URL` | — | POST alert JSON anywhere |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | enable Postgres archival |
| `REDIS_URL` | — | enable Redis cache/pubsub |

Invalid configuration fails fast at startup with a readable message.

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/rules -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "whale buys",
  "minWallets": 4,
  "windowSeconds": 45,
  "minUsd": 100000,
  "minConviction": 70,
  "cooldownSeconds": 300,
  "kinds": ["BUY"]
}'
```

## Deployment (Railway)

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` and `railway.json` (health check on `/health`,
restart-on-failure). To keep it live on Railway:

1. Create a project from this repo — Railway builds the `Dockerfile`.
2. Add env vars (at minimum a notification channel; `CHAIN_WS_URL` for live).
3. *(optional)* Add the Railway **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** plugins; set
   `DATABASE_URL` / `REDIS_URL`. Run `npm run prisma:migrate` to create tables.

The image generates the Prisma client at build time and runs migrations only
when a database is attached; without one it runs fully in-memory.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev         # watch mode
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest (detection, conviction, seed)
npm run build       # compile to dist/
```

Tests cover the swarm/rotation detection state machine, the 0–100 conviction
scoring, and the seed-data derivation (72 unique wallets, 5 cross-coin).
